:markdown
  JBoss Developer Framework provides guides for migrating to Java EE 6 from Seam 2, Spring and Java EE 5.

  * [Seam 2 -> Java EE 6](../seam2/open18_migration)
  * [Spring -> Java EE 6](spring)
  * [Java EE 5 -> Java EE 6](javaee5)
    * [JBoss AS 5 or JBoss AS 6 -> JBoss AS 7](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/How+do+I+migrate+my+application+from+AS5+or+AS6+to+AS7)

  Ok, but when do I migrate?
  --------------------------

  Having read the migration guides you now have some ideas about how to migrate, but how do you decide when to migrate?
