  JBoss Developer Framework provides guides for migrating to Java EE 6 from Seam 2, Spring and Java EE 5.

  * [Seam 2 -> Java EE 6](../seam2/open18_migration)
  * [Spring -> Java EE 6](spring)
  * [Java EE 5 -> Java EE 6](javaee5)
    * [JBoss AS 5 or JBoss AS 6 -> JBoss AS 7](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/How+do+I+migrate+my+application+from+AS5+or+AS6+to+AS7)


  Visit [JBoss Migration Center](http://www.jboss.org/migration/) for open source migration assessment tools and guides for migrating your applications from Oracle WebLogic Server, JBoss EAP4.x/AS4.x and JBoss EAP5.x/AS5.x to JBoss EAP 6.x/AS7.x.



  Ok, but what migration path should I take?

            Java EE is backwards compatible, so your application should run on [JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6](http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/application-platform/) or [JBoss AS 7](http://jboss.org/jbossas).

            Java EE 6 is a superset of Java EE 5 so choose [JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6](http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/application-platform/) or [JBoss AS 7](http://jboss.org/jbossas). [JBoss Developer Framework](#{site.base_url}) provides a good resource to learn the stack.
