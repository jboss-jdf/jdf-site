JBoss Developer Framework 1.0 focuses on showing you how to use vanilla Java Enterprise Edition 6, with a choice of view layers:

* HTML5 - JavaScript and CSS control the views, RESTful endpoints provide server interaction.
* Errai and GWT - The server side APIs, such as CDI, are made available in the browser, ideal for large web applications
* RichFaces & JSF - UI component framework for easily integrating Ajax into business applications using JSF
  
To achieve this, we provide:

* More than 50 quickstarts, with topics from RESTful CRUD to distributed transactions. Each quickstart shows a use case or API in isolation.
* The TicketMonster application, a full web-app showing off HTML5 + REST, RichFaces and Errai, as well as JPA, JAX-RS, Bean Validaton and CDI, with a complete guide, showing you how to build the app for yourself.
* Migration guides for Spring, Seam 2 (Dan Allen's Seam In Action Open18 application) and Java EE 5

Finally, in order to make navigating the JBoss Java EE stack a bit easier, the JBoss BOMs project provides a recommended set of dependencies for any Maven Repository based build system.
