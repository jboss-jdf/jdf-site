Release 2.0 of JBoss Developer Framework focuses on building mobile hybrid applications:

* Apache Cordova, building on the excellent work of the AeroGear team
* JBoss Stacks

To do this, we provide:

* TicketMonster as a native application, compiled from HTML5 using Cordova
* A quickstart, showing how to get started with Cordova

Finally, JBoss Stacks, gives you a quick and easy view onto what archetypes and BOMs are available from JBoss to build applications.
