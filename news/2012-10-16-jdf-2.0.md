  JBoss Developer Framework 2.0 is where we start to go beyond pure Java Enterprise Edition and start to explore how you can add some of the exciting new developments to your Java EE applications.

  In 2.0 we add support for Apache Cordova, which allows you write native applications for phones and tablets. For now, we're just showing you how to get started with Cordova, and compile an existing HTML5 application to native. We'll revisit mobile in the next year, and look at how you can access native functionality.

  Since JBoss Developer Framework 2.0 we've added JBoss Stacks, which gives you a view onto what BOMs and archetypes are available in the JBoss ecosystem, as well as letting you know what runtimes we recommend.
